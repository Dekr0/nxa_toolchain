- This coding style is heavily basedon Odin style with minor modifications 
inspired by Go and C.
    - `struct`, `enum` and `enum value`, `union` are pascal case with underscore 
    (`Pascal_Case`),
    - function names, variable names, `struct` and `union` field names are 
    lower case snake case,
    - open brace and close brace should has its own lines,
    - open brace and close brace should be in the same line for short statement,
    - use single letter variable when
        - short-lived scope
